## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Testing Plan

Start by reading `testing-plan.md` to understand:
- Testing objectives and framework
- Tool categories and testing approach
- Test execution phases (20-day plan)
- Performance benchmarks and success metrics

### 2. Explore the Tool Inventory

Check `tool-inventory.md` for:
- Complete list of all 78 tools
- Tool descriptions and categories
- Testing priorities (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Testing timeline by priority

### 3. Execute Manual Tests

Use `test-execution-template.md` to:
- Document test execution consistently
- Track test results and issues
- Ensure comprehensive coverage
- Generate test reports

### 4. Implement Automated Testing

Follow `test-automation-framework.md` to:
- Set up the automated test environment
- Implement test classes for each tool
- Configure continuous integration
- Generate automated reports

## Testing Priorities

The 78 tools are prioritized as follows:

- **Critical Priority**: 8 tools (Week 1)
- **High Priority**: 20 tools (Week 2)
- **Medium Priority**: 35 tools (Weeks 3-4)
- **Low Priority**: 15 tools (Week 4)

## Key Testing Areas

1. **Basic Functionality**: Verify core operations
2. **Error Handling**: Test failure scenarios
3. **Performance**: Measure speed and resource usage
4. **Security**: Validate input handling and access control
5. **Integration**: Test tool combinations
6. **Compatibility**: Cross-browser and platform testing

## Success Criteria

- 100% coverage for critical priority tools
- 95% coverage for high priority tools
- 80% coverage for medium priority tools
- 60% coverage for low priority tools
- Zero critical security issues
- Performance within defined benchmarks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Access to advanced-web-tools MCP server
- Test browser environments (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Test Execution Workflow

### Manual Testing

1. Select tool from inventory
2. Use test execution template
3. Document results thoroughly
4. File issues for failures
5. Update test status tracking

### Automated Testing

1. Run automated test suite
2. Review generated reports
3. Investigate failures
4. Update test cases as needed
5. Monitor CI/CD pipeline

## Reporting

Test results are generated in multiple formats:
